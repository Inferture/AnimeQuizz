# Anime Trivia

## General

Project made during the course "Mobile development Android" in Telecom SudParis

Should work on Android 4.4 or higher

Uses Light sensor in the option menu to choose between light and dark theme, but should work without
any (you can also change the theme manually)


## What works now:

Play in solo or in split screen duo on some anime trivia questions from the open trivia database
Make your own questions
Play on your own questions

You can also check the anime from which a question is from on myanimelist, though the database of
trivia questions and myanimelist aren't linked so the accuracy cannot be guaranteed to be 100%
It still works fairly well from experience.



## Ideas for improvment:

Bluetooth multiplayer (maybe even more that 2 players)
Bluetooth question sharing
